# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

In **Factory Design Pattern**, there is a factory class which is going to create the objects of different classes on the basis of requirement while **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** will going to create factories which will further going to create the objects of different sub-classes.

In **Factory Design Pattern** we create objects on the basis of if-else condition while in **Abstract Factory Design Pattern** we can create objects of sub-classes by having the factory class for each sub-classes in order to get rid from if-else condition.

This design pattern make code abstract and decoupled which isolates the concrete class from client by adding extra abstract layer in between which makes code more flexible and easy to manage.
